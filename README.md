## Milestones

- None, because _**innovation** must not be restrained with time or specificity._ It instead **must flow with crazyness & stupidity**.

### GOALS

* Think-tank about the future of digital advertising.
* Proof-of-concept of new technologies for digital ad serving.
* Thought processes about crazy things our heads just happen to think of.
* Everything else.


### TODOS

If everything has already been done then we guess everything is waiting to be done again. Just differently.
